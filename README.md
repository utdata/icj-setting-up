These lessons outline how to set up your computer for the [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class), a class in the School of Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. If you are new to coding, I suggest you begin with the [Getting Started](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class/start-00-intro.html) chapter there.

Both macOS and Windows platforms are covered with these instructions. Chromebooks and tablets are not supported for this class.

If you are using a UT lab computer, get with your instructor.

- [Setup part 1](setup-part-1.md) we do at the beginning of the semester
- [Setup part 2](setup-part-2.md) we do in the middle of the semester
