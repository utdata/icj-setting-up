These lessons outline how to set up your computer for development using the technologies introduced in [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class). If you are new to coding or the class, I suggest you start with the [Getting Started](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class/start-00-intro.html) chapter there.

If you are using a UT lab computer you'll have to learn about some setup. Get with your instructor.
