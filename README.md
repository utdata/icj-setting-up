These lessons outline how to set up your computer for the class [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class). If you are new to coding, I suggest you start with the [Getting Started](https://utdata.github.io/icj-class/start-00-intro.html) chapter there.

We cover both macOS and Windows in these instructions. Chromebooks are not supported for this class.

If you are using a UT lab computer, get with your instructor.
