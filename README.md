> This is what came before

These lessons outline how to set up your computer for development using the technologies introduced in [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://github.com/utdata/icj-class). This is written as basic **steps to accomplish** without much explanation of what you are doing and why. If you are new to coding or the class, I suggest you start with the [command-line interface tools lesson](https://github.com/utdata/icj-cli-tools) instead. You'll get back here soon enough.

If you are using a UT lab computer you'll have to learn about some setup. Get with your instructor.
